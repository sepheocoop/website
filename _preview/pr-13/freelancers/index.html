<dd>
<p>If you&#8217;re freelancer and want to support Sepheo, meet other
members and have a say in the direction Sepheo takes, you can join as
a <strong>member</strong>.  What this means:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can consult our matchmakers. Through them you can access the
directory of other members, leads, and organisations. They will help
you to search for opportunities and collaborators. You will also be
invited to get in touch with other members in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You get consulted on major organisational decisions, since Sepheo is
a members association. In the first instance, this means you can
come to the online quarterly members calls, at which we update
members on the latest news, and hold the steward and matchmaker
elections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You fund the creation of more and/or better services with a pledge
to pay a minimum of Â£5/month. This an investment in Sepheo, a
non-profit that exists for the benefits of its members,
i.e. you. After administrative costs, any surplus funds are pooled
to spend on more and/or better services for members later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">How?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contribute as a "Member" on our Open Collective
page. <a href="/_preview/pr-13/membership/">More details here&#8230;&#8203;</a></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">What then?</dt>
<dd>
<p>We&#8217;ll get in touch, invite you to join our members'
Matrix chat, and give details of how to go from there.</p>

<h2 id="_future_aspirations"><a id="aspirations"></a>Future aspirations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By growing our network organically, and accumulating funds from
membership fees and matchmaking fees, plan to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incorporate our organisation (although it will always remain a co-operative!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay stewards and matchmakers for their labour.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these will be needed to improve the resilience of the
organisation, which is otherwise dependent on pro-bono contributions
and puts stewards and matchmakers on the line as decision
makers. Voluntary workers who perform critical roles are notoriously
subject to burn-out!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The better-resourced stewards and matchmakers can then, should the
membership still wish it, try to raise more funding and build more
services, perhaps with more labour or capital requirements. Some
ideas:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mutual support and special interest groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partnerships with service providers, buyers clubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mutual insurance, bread funds, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training, mentoring and up-skilling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools and guidelines for team formation and governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistance with incorporation of these teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are examples - ultimately it depends on our resources and what
the membership asks for.</p>
