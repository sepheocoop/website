<p>This page outlines what freelancers can expect to get from <a href="/_preview/pr-13/">Sepheo</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As it says on the <a href="/_preview/pr-13/">front page</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We aim to support the important role freelancers play in the world of business, by providing a platform for <strong>skills exchange between freelancers and their clients</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this means: in the first instance, we:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compile a <strong>directory</strong> of freelancers, clients, and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forge <strong>partnership</strong> deals with the service providers used by freelancers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then through this we:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actively create <strong>networking opportunities</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively find <strong>matches</strong> between clients and freelancers, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate <strong>building teams</strong> to tender for and deliver solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, we are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Self-funded,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run by freelancers, for freelancers, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organised democratically and accountably using the principles of the <a href="https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rochdale Pioneers</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy#Core_values_and_principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidarity Economy</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Introductions</strong> are therefore a key service we provide to our members and their clients, but in a way vastly cheaper to use for clients than a conventional recruitment agency - and more attuned to the needs of freelancers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We achieve this at the moment because we are run on a shoestring with a lot of help from our members. Later, we hope to raise funds from our members to support more ambitious goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can support and have a hand in guiding this by <a href="/_preview/pr-13/freelancers/#membership">becoming a member</a></p>

<h3 id="_talk_to_us">Talk to us</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re listening. See the links on our <a href="/_preview/pr-13/">front page</a> for ways of reaching us.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Why?</strong> If you just want to find out more, or perhaps you&#8217;re looking
for opportunities but don&#8217;t want to commit to paying the fee or being
involved too much with Sepheo, you can sign up as an <strong>affiliate</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>How?</strong> To do this, simply register on our directory <a href="/_preview/pr-13/register/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may want to have your contact details, skills and CV handy, as
this is the main information we&#8217;re gathering in the form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have them, it also helps to have details of your:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://opencollective.com/home">Open Collective</a> user account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/_preview/pr-13/matrix/">Matrix</a> user account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What then?</strong> You will then receive periodic status checks on your
availability and to ensure the directory details we have on you are up
to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you give us your Matrix User ID, you&#8217;ll also get an invitation to
our General chat room on <a href="/_preview/pr-13/matrix/">our Matrix server</a>, through which
you can contact members and other affiliates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We may also contact about opportunities which arise that need your
skills, and networking events in your area.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_join_as_a_member"><a id="membership"></a>Join as a Member</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Why?</strong> If you&#8217;re freelancer and want to support Sepheo, meet other
members and have a say in the direction Sepheo takes, you can join as
a <strong>member</strong>.  What this means:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can consult our matchmakers. Through them you can access the
directory of other members, leads, and organisations. They will help
you to search for opportunities and collaborators. You will also be
invited to get in touch with other members in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You get consulted on major organisational decisions, since Sepheo is
a members association. In the first instance, this means you can
come to the online quarterly members calls, at which we update
members on the latest news, and hold the steward and matchmaker
elections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You fund the creation of more and/or better services with a pledge
to pay a minimum of Â£5/month. This an investment in Sepheo, a
non-profit that exists for the benefits of its members,
i.e. you. After administrative costs, any surplus funds are pooled
to spend on more and/or better services for members later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>How?</strong> Follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Start by <strong>creating an account on <a href="https://opencollective.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Collective</a></strong>,
if you don&#8217;t have one. This is where we manage funds and pay
expenses. You&#8217;ll notice this is entirely open and transparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/_preview/pr-13/register/">Register</a> as an affiliate</strong> - if you&#8217;ve not done that
already (see <a href="#affiliation">above</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then on our <a href="https://opencollective.com/sepheocoop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Collective</a>
page, logged in with your account there, <strong>select "Contribute" within
the "Member" option</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What then?</strong> We&#8217;ll get in touch, invite you to join our members'
 Matrix chat, and give details of how to go from there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Members are eligible to put themselves forward for the steward and
matchmaker roles.
- Stewards are responsible for steering the organisation. They act on
  behalf of the membership.  The role is currently pro-bono.
- Matchmakers are responsible for curating the network and helping
  members find opportunities. They share a finders fee from a
  successful matches with the organisation.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_future_aspirations"><a id="aspirations"></a>Future aspirations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By growing our network organically, and accumulating funds from
membership fees and matchmaking fees, we aim to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incorporate our organisation (although it will always remain a co-operative!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay stewards and matchmakers for their labour.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these will be needed to improve the resilience of the
organisation, which is otherwise dependent on pro-bono contributions
and puts stewards and matchmakers on the line as decision
makers. Voluntary workers who perform critical roles are notoriously
subject to burn-out!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The better-resourced stewards and matchmakers can then, should the
membership still wish it, try to raise more funding and build more
services, perhaps with more labour or capital requirements such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mutual support and special interest groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partnerships with service providers, buyers clubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mutual insurance, bread funds, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training, mentoring and up-skilling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools and guidelines for team formation and governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistance with incorporation of these teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although all of this depends on what the membership asks Sepheo to do&#8230;&#8203;</p>
