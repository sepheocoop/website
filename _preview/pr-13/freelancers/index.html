<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are a mutual support network run by freelancers for freelancers,
providing a platform for <strong>skills exchange</strong>. We do this by:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compiling a <strong>directory</strong> of freelancers, organisations, and leads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organising <strong>networking events</strong> in person and online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building <strong>teams</strong> of freelancers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matching</strong> freelancers to organisations' needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are self-funded, and organised democratically and accountably using the
principles of the
<a href="https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rochdale
Pioneers</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy#Core_values_and_principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidarity
Economy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We currently achieve our core aims with minimal costs. In future, we
have ambitious goals to expand our network, with the help of our
members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can be a part of this by <a href="/_preview/pr-13/freelancers/#membership">becoming a member</a>.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic idea works for all sorts of trades. We encourage diversity,
because in general all teams need a diverse range of skills. Saying
that, finding good matches depends on the mix of people and their
skills we have in our directory at any moment. This will change over
time - but you can find out more if you get in touch.</p>

opportunities - but without committing to making contributions or
getting involved.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">How?</dt>

<p>To do this, simply register on our directory. <a href="/_preview/pr-13/affiliation/">More details here&#8230;&#8203;</a></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">What then?</dt>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Why?</dt>
<dd>
<p>You&#8217;re freelancer: you&#8217;ll want to find collaborators and
clients. You will also be helping us help <strong>you</strong> by supporting our
platform.  What this means&#8230;&#8203;</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You get put in touch</strong> with other members in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You can consult our matchmakers.</strong> Through them you can access the
directory of other members, leads, and organisations. They will help
you to search for opportunities and collaborators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You get consulted on major organisational decisions.</strong> Sepheo is a
members' association.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first instance, this means you can come to the online quarterly
  members calls. There we report back to our members, consult them,
  and elect the steward and matchmakers.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You fund the creation of more and/or better services</strong> with a pledge
to pay a minimum of Â£5/month. This an investment in Sepheo, a
non-profit that exists for the benefits of its members,
i.e. <strong>you</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">How?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contribute as a "Member" on our Open Collective
page. <a href="/_preview/pr-13/membership/">More details here&#8230;&#8203;</a></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">What then?</dt>
<dd>
<p>We&#8217;ll get in touch, invite you to join our members'
Matrix chat, and give details of how to go from there.</p>

<h2 id="_future_aspirations"><a id="aspirations"></a>Future aspirations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our plan is to growing our network organically, accumulating funds from
membership fees and matchmaking fees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the funds permit it, we then:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incorporate our organisation (although it will always remain a co-operative!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay stewards and matchmakers for their labour.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These will improve resilience and widen the options available to the
organisation. Stewards and matchmakers will be given greater security
and therefore the means to better serve the organisation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this works to plan, members get better support, more opportunities,
and newcomers more reasons to join. With better funding, the
organisation could become more ambitious with the services it
provides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some ideas of things this could lead to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mutual support and special interest groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buyers' clubs to negotiate reduced prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mutual insurance, bread funds, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training, mentoring and up-skilling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools and guidelines for team formation and governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for incorporation of these teams as businesses in their own right.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, we want to support <strong>existing co-operatives</strong>, create
<strong>new co-operatives</strong> and promote co-operative culture generally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, these are just examples - ultimately it depends on our
resources and what the membership asks for.</p>
