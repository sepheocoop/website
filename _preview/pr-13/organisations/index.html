<p>This page outlines what freelancers can expect to get from <a href="/_preview/pr-13/">Sepheo</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When managing an organisation, typically you need to manage periods of
boom and bust with agility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When opportunities arise you need more people. Conversely you may have
to shrink your workforce when work is scarce. And this has to be
balanced against commitment to your existing employees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And perhaps you need specialised or short-term help.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are examples of where temporary help can be essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sepheo aims to facilitate your relationship building with freelancers.</p>

<h2 id="_how_we_help_you">How we help you</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We maintain a directory of freelancers, their skills, and
organisations who use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is curated by our matchmakers - members of Sepheo who have
been selected to make introductions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can contact our matchmakers for help finding people with the
right skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you register with us, our members can also contact our
matchmakers to find you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we find satisfactory matches for you whom you then hire, we ask
for an introduction fee. (Currently this is negotiable whilst we
tune the service, later will provide guidelines for the amount.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your relationship with the freelancer is then your business - you
hire directly, not through us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are a non-profit, therefore this is likely cheaper than using a
recruitment agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are accountable to our members - therefore we are likely to
understand their skill-sets better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are a co-operative or employee owned organisation, You may also like that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We support co-operative principles: democracy, self ownership,
collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our members will understand co-operative organisations better than
most - because they are part of one.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_what_we_are_not">What we are not</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are <strong>not</strong> an agency:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don&#8217;t hire us, and we don&#8217;t hire our members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not intermediates in the supply chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the initial introduction, your relationship to freelancers is direct.</p>

</ul>
