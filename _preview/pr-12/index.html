<h2 id="_are_you_a_freelancer_contracting_self_employed">Are you a freelancer? Contracting? Self Employed?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If so, we are run by freelancers for freelancers. We aim to support people like you!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Freelancing can be rewarding, but it can also be challenging. It requires a breadth of skills beyond the core skillset for which you get paid. You need to be able to manage your business, your training, your networking and marketing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our insight is that co-operation is key to success. You have autonomy, but you also need support and a community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you feel like you would benefit from being supported by your peers - we think we can help you!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, perhaps you&#8217;re ahead of the game? Experienced, well networked, and adept at keeping the plates in the air. Then please get in touch anyway! You can still benefit from connecting to people who may have complementary skills and resources.</p>

<p>Organisations typically need to adapt to changing demands and turn-over in their membership.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also aim to support you!  A freelancer network is symbiotic with its customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a co-operative, we especially love co-operative organisations. One of the principles of a co-operative is to co-operate with others.  But we we work with all sorts of organisations, a diversity of aims and structures is to be celebrated.</p>
