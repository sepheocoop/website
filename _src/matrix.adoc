= Our Matrix rooms

https://matrix.org/[Matrix^] is a secure, open-source chat platform,
similar to Slack, Mattermost, or Discord. 

Matrix channels are called "rooms".

There is more than one client application, but the main one is called
https://element.io/[Element^], which runs on the web or on your phone.

It is possible to bridge Matrix rooms to other platforms, and we hope
to use that to allow people to join us from other platforms. This is a
work in progress, however!

Our "General" matrix room, which is for members and affiliates, is
https://matrix.to/#/!SHryzSYEdMpXUCNuyV:spacetu.be?via=matrix.org&via=digitalcommons.coop&via=spacetu.be[here^]. We
also have others for different purposes, and these are used as our
primary means for coordination.
