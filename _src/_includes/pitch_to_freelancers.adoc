We aim to support the important role freelancers play in the world of business, by providing a platform for *skills exchange between freelancers and their clients*.

What this means: in the first instance, we:

- Compile a *directory* of freelancers, clients, and opportunities.
- Forge *partnership* deals with the service providers used by freelancers.
- Then through this we:
  * Actively create *networking opportunities*,
  * Actively find *matches* between clients and freelancers, and
  * Facilitate *building teams* to tender for and deliver solutions.

Additionally, we are:

- Self-funded,
- Run by freelancers, for freelancers, and
- Organised democratically and accountably using the principles of the https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles[Rochdale Pioneers^] and the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy#Core_values_and_principles[Solidarity Economy^].

*Introductions* are therefore a key service we provide to our members and their clients, but in a way vastly cheaper to use for clients than a conventional recruitment agency - and more attuned to the needs of freelancers.

We achieve this at the moment because we are run on a shoestring with a lot of help from our members. Later, we hope to raise funds from our members to support more ambitious goals.
