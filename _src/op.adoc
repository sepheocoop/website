include::index.adoc[]
////
NOTE: this file exists to allow URLs to https://sepheo.co/op to reach
the landing page content.

It replaces the mechanism used with a markdown index.md, which doesn't
currently work with AsciiDoc. See https://github.com/saneef/eleventy-plugin-asciidoc/issues/21

However, a front-matter block (delimited with `---`) *may* be inserted
into an .adoc file in the context of Elventy, using
eleventy-asciidoc-plugin.  However, this will get inserted verbatim as
text when combined with the include above.  So we don't do that!

Front-matter blocks are otherwise fine in .adoc files.
