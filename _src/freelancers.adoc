== How to connect with Sepheo

Interested? There are several ways to connect if so...

=== Talk to us

We're listening. See the links on our link:/[front page] for ways of reaching us.

=== [[affiliation]]Register and become an Affiliate

*Why?* If you just want to find out more, or perhaps you're looking
for opportunities but don't want to commit to paying the fee or being
involved too much with Sepheo, you can sign up as an *affiliate*.

*How?* To do this, simply register on our directory link:/register/[here].

- You may want to have your contact details, skills and CV handy, as
  this is the main information we're gathering in the form.
- If you have them, it also helps to have details of your:
  * link:{open-collective}[Open Collective] user account
  *  link:/matrix/[Matrix] user account.

*What then?* You will then receive periodic status checks on your
availability and to ensure the directory details we have on you are up
to date.

If you give us your Matrix User ID, you'll also get an invitation to
our General chat room on link:/matrix/[our Matrix server], through which
you can contact members and other affiliates.

We may also contact about opportunities which arise that need your
skills, and networking events in your area.

=== [[membership]]Join as a Member

*Why?* If you're freelancer and want to support Sepheo, meet other
members and have a say in the direction Sepheo takes, you can join as
a *member*.  What this means:

- You can consult our matchmakers. Through them you can access the
  directory of other members, leads, and organisations. They will help
  you to search for opportunities and collaborators. You will also be
  invited to get in touch with other members in your area.
- You get consulted on major organisational decisions, since Sepheo is
  a members association. In the first instance, this means you can
  come to the online quarterly members calls, at which we update
  members on the latest news, and hold the steward and matchmaker
  elections.
- You fund the creation of more and/or better services with a pledge
  to pay a minimum of Â£5/month. This an investment in Sepheo, a
  non-profit that exists for the benefits of its members,
  i.e. you. After administrative costs, any surplus funds are pooled
  to spend on more and/or better services for members later.

*How?* Follow these steps:

. Start by *creating an account on link:{open-collective}[Open Collective^]*,
  if you don't have one. This is where we manage funds and pay
  expenses. You'll notice this is entirely open and transparent.
. *link:/register/[Register] as an affiliate* - if you've not done that
  already (see xref:#affiliation[above].)
. Then on our https://opencollective.com/sepheocoop[Open Collective^]
  page, logged in with your account there, *select "Contribute" within
  the "Member" option*.

*What then?* We'll get in touch, invite you to join our members'
 Matrix chat, and give details of how to go from there.

Members are eligible to put themselves forward for the steward and
matchmaker roles.
- Stewards are responsible for steering the organisation. They act on
  behalf of the membership.  The role is currently pro-bono.
- Matchmakers are responsible for curating the network and helping
  members find opportunities. They share a finders fee from a
  successful matches with the organisation.


== [[aspirations]]Future aspirations

By growing our network organically, and accumulating funds from
membership fees and matchmaking fees, we aim to:

- Incorporate our organisation (although it will always remain a co-operative!)
- Pay stewards and matchmakers for their labour.

Both of these will be needed to improve the resilience of the
organisation, which is otherwise dependent on pro-bono contributions
and puts stewards and matchmakers on the line as decision
makers. Voluntary workers who perform critical roles are notoriously
subject to burn-out!

The better-resourced stewards and matchmakers can then, should the
membership still wish it, try to raise more funding and build more
services, perhaps with more labour or capital requirements such as:

- Mutual support and special interest groups.
- Partnerships with service providers, buyers clubs.
- Mutual insurance, bread funds, etc.
- Training, mentoring and up-skilling.
- Tools and guidelines for team formation and governance.
- Assistance with incorporation of these teams.

Although all of this depends on what the membership asks Sepheo to do...
