<p>SEPHEO (Self-Employed People Helping Each Other) Coop is a mutual society for self-employed professionals. We make it easy for freelancers to connect with coops and other aligned organisations.</p>
<p>As a coop, we subscribe to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles">Rochdale Co-operative principles</a>, and the <a href="https://solidarityeconomyprinciples.org/">Solidarity Economy principles</a>.</p>
<p>The problem: whilst employment in a typical company can be alienating (for reasons well understood to the co-op movement), co-ops are not a widely accessible alternative for most people. Their relative rarity, low visibility and unfamiliarity mean they're often not perceived as existing, yet alone as a possible alternative - even then they may be dismissed. In the other direction, co-ops often require a much higher degree of trust to grant membership than they would employment.</p>
<p>Freelancing is another way to attain more autonomy, and is becoming more common in the contemporary &quot;gig economy&quot;, but can be precarious and isolating. It requires various legal, business, and social expertises outside the core skills of a professional - not to mention the confidence to attain these.</p>
<p>Our aim is to make co-operatives more visible and easier to access through the intermediate step of freelancing within co-operative contexts. Likewise, to make freelancers more visible and easier to access for co-operatives.</p>
<p>Sepheo connects co-operatives and freelancers by regularly checking-in with coops about their capacity needs and maintaining a list of freelancers that want to work with co-ops.</p>
<p>In the long term we want to act as a generative force in the coop economy, multiplying the efforts of others beyond what they thought possible.</p>
